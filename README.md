# GreenCare

GreenCare is a full-stack application to keep track of user plants needs, and shares with other people their urban gardens.
It was made as my the final project at the Ironhack Web Development Bootcamp in two weeks.

## Features

  - Designed to be use on mobile phones.
  - Users creation and update.
  - Plants's and users's images managed with a CDN
  - Plants geolocation by default, and editable by the user.
  - Creation of fertilising and watering recurrent tasks for the plants
  - Detailed plants info automatically added when users add or update their plants.
  - Authentication and authorization of users
  - Map showing other users gardens
  - Possibility to see other users profiles and check their plants
  - Two weeks calendar with icons showing water/fertiliser tasks and weather forecast
